# BEK (Secure Code)

Homework for class secure code.

- `lab03`: We needed to create C code with buffer overflow and then perform attack on it to run arbitrary executable.
I performed attack with stack protectors turned on and with non-executable stack.

- `lab07`: Simple application for setting system time which uses capabilities and is split into two executables for security.
- `lab08`: Performing sql-injection on vulnerable school server.
- `lab11`: Performing XSS attack on school site to steal cookies of other students.
